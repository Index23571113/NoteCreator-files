# NoteCreator-files
This is my beginner PyQt5 project, created for learning purposes. Itâ€™s a small application designed to help me practice GUI development, file handling, and basic class structures in Python.

NoteCreator.bat and NoteCreator.vbs are runner files for Windows.The main project file is NoteMachine_Window.py, which uses a small class and a main dictionary defined in NoteMachine_class.py.Notes.pkl is the file where all note data is stored.

The application creates the Notes.pkl file in the same folder as NoteMachine_Window.py. This file is used to store data when the application is closed.
